# 🏢 CAPT Lounge Booking Bot

A Telegram Mini App for booking time slots at NUS CAPT's house lounges, shared across all five houses:

| House | Color | Floors |
|---|---|---|
| 🐺 Roc | Blue | 3, 4, 5 |
| 🐉 Dragon | Green | 6, 7, 8 |
| 🐤 Garuda | Yellow | 9, 10, 11 |
| 🐦‍🔥 Phoenix | Red | 12, 13, 14 |
| 🐎 Tulpar | Black | 15, 16, 17 |

This bot provides a mobile-first interface for residents to select their house, floor, date, and multi-hour time slots, with automatic profile integration from Telegram. It's a single shared deployment across all five houses, so hosting costs (and maintenance) are split rather than borne by one house alone.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **Telegram Mini App Integration** — Seamless integration with Telegram Mini Apps and `initDataUnsafe` profile autofill.
- 🏠 **Multi-House, Multi-Level Support** — Independent booking tracks for all 15 floors across Roc, Dragon, Garuda, Phoenix, and Tulpar, each with its own live-switching theme color.
- 👀 **At-a-Glance Dashboard** — Native-feeling horizontal swipe interface for viewing upcoming bookings by floor.
- 🧠 **Smart Slot Grouping** — Frontend algorithm automatically merges consecutive 1-hour slots into clean, human-readable blocks (e.g., 12:00 - 15:00).
- 📅 **Interactive Calendar** — Highlights selection, disables past dates, and prevents invalid ranges.
- ⏰ **Multi-Slot Selection** — Book multiple consecutive hourly slots in a single transaction.
- 👤 **User Profile Autofill** — Automatic profile data retrieval from the Telegram web app payload.
- 🛡️ **Int64 Data Sanitization** — Safely handles large Telegram IDs by forcing string conversion, preventing 32-bit integer overflows and floating-point precision loss in SQLite.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** — SQLite database optimized for cloud deployment with Railway Volume mounting for data durability.
- 🔒 **Proxy-Aware & Secure** — Server configured for `trust proxy`, rate limiting, and authorization checks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn`
- A Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- HTTPS-enabled web hosting for Telegram Mini Apps

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Garuda-Techs/LoungeBookingBot.git
cd LoungeBookingBot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the environment

Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your variables:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
WEB_APP_URL=https://your-app-url
NODE_ENV=production
TRUST_PROXY=true
PORT=3000
DB_PATH=/app/data/lounge_bookings.db
```

#### Deployment Notes

- Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` in production when the app runs behind a reverse proxy (Railway, Heroku, Nginx, etc.).
- For persistence on Railway, mount a Volume to `/app/data` and set `DB_PATH=/app/data/lounge_bookings.db`.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `public/js/houses.js` — Shared house config (name, color, emoji, floor range per house) used by both the frontend and the backend.
- `public/js/app.js` — Frontend logic (house/level switching, multi-slot selection, calendar tweaks).
- `server.js` — Express server configured with `trust proxy`, rate limiting, and JSON parsing.
- `routes/bookings.js` — Secure API endpoints featuring data sanitization for availability, booking, and cancellations across all houses.
- `database.js` — SQLite schema initialization and connection pooling.
- `bot.js` — Telegram bot logic that opens the mini app and handles commands.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Get Available Slots

`GET /api/bookings/available/:date?level=9`

Returns available and booked slots for the specified lounge level and date. `level` accepts any floor 3–17 (Roc 3-5, Dragon 6-8, Garuda 9-11, Phoenix 12-14, Tulpar 15-17).

Response sample:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-15",
  "level": 9,
  "available": ["08:00", "09:00", "10:00"],
  "bookedDetails": [
    {
      "time_slot": "11:00",
      "first_name": "Alice",
      "telegram_username": "alice_tg",
      "notes": "Study session"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Get Upcoming Bookings

`GET /api/bookings/upcoming/:level`

Returns active bookings strictly bounded from the current day to the end of the following calendar week (Sunday).

### Create Booking

`POST /api/bookings`

Accepts an array of consecutive hourly slots. The server validates `lounge_level` against every floor across all 5 houses (3–17), and checks overlaps/conflicts per lounge level.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "telegramUser": { "id": "987654321", "first_name": "Bob" },
  "lounge_level": 9,
  "date": "2026-03-15",
  "timeSlots": ["08:00", "09:00"],
  "notes": "Project meeting"
}
```

### Get User Bookings

`GET /api/bookings/user/:telegramId`

Returns active bookings for the requested Telegram user. Uses strict string matching to support large user IDs.

### Cancel Booking

`DELETE /api/bookings/:id`

Cancellation requires the Telegram ID to match the booking owner; the server verifies authorization via database JOINs.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "telegramId": "987654321"
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Data Integrity

- **Data Type Safety:** Telegram IDs are explicitly cast to strings and sanitized to prevent `.0` float artifacts in the database.
- **Trust Proxy:** Support for correct client IP handling behind cloud proxies.
- **Rate Limiting:** Middleware to mitigate API abuse while allowing trusted proxies.
- **Parameterized Queries:** SQL queries use `?` placeholders to prevent SQL injection.
- **Ownership Verification:** Strict authorization subqueries for cancellation and booking management.

---

## 🌐 Deployment (Railway Recommended)

1. Create and mount a **Volume** at `/app/data` to persist `lounge_bookings.db` across container restarts.
2. Set the required environment variables in your Railway project settings (including ADMIN_IDS).
3. Deploy the project and ensure HTTPS is enabled for the generated web app URL (a strict Telegram requirement).
