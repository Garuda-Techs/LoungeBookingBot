# 🦅 CAPT Garuda Lounge Booking Bot

A Telegram Mini App for booking time slots at the CAPT Garuda Lounge (Levels 9, 10, and 11). This bot provides a mobile-first interface for residents to select lounge levels, dates, and multi-hour time slots with automatic profile integration from Telegram.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **Telegram Mini App Integration** — Seamless integration with Telegram Mini Apps and `initDataUnsafe` profile autofill.
- 🏢 **Multi-Level Support** — Independent booking tracks for Level 9, 10, and 11 lounges.
- 👀 **At-a-Glance Dashboard** — Native-feeling horizontal swipe interface for viewing upcoming bookings by floor.
- 🧠 **Smart Slot Grouping** — Frontend algorithm automatically merges consecutive 1-hour slots into clean, human-readable blocks (e.g., 12:00 - 15:00).
- 📅 **Interactive Calendar** — Highlights selection, disables past dates, and prevents invalid ranges.
- ⏰ **Multi-Slot Selection** — Book multiple consecutive hourly slots in a single transaction.
- 👤 **User Profile Autofill** — Automatic profile data retrieval from the Telegram web app payload.
- 🛡️ **Int64 Data Sanitization** — Safely handles large Telegram IDs by forcing string conversion, preventing 32-bit integer overflows and floating-point precision loss in SQLite.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** — SQLite database optimized for cloud deployment with Railway Volume mounting for data durability.
- 🔒 **Proxy-Aware & Secure** — Server configured for `trust proxy`, rate limiting, and authorization checks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn`
- A Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- HTTPS-enabled web hosting for Telegram Mini Apps

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Garuda-Techs/LoungeBookingBot.git
cd LoungeBookingBot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the environment

Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your variables:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
WEB_APP_URL=https://your-app-url
NODE_ENV=production
TRUST_PROXY=true
PORT=3000
DB_PATH=/app/data/lounge_bookings.db
```

#### Deployment Notes

- Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` in production when the app runs behind a reverse proxy (Railway, Heroku, Nginx, etc.).
- For persistence on Railway, mount a Volume to `/app/data` and set `DB_PATH=/app/data/lounge_bookings.db`.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `public/js/app.js` — Frontend logic (level switching, multi-slot selection, calendar tweaks).
- `server.js` — Express server configured with `trust proxy`, rate limiting, and JSON parsing.
- `routes/bookings.js` — Secure API endpoints featuring data sanitization for availability, booking, and cancellations.
- `database.js` — SQLite schema initialization and connection pooling.
- `bot.js` — Telegram bot logic that opens the mini app and handles commands.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Get Available Slots

`GET /api/bookings/available/:date?level=9`

Returns available and booked slots for the specified lounge level and date.

Response sample:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-15",
  "level": 9,
  "available": ["08:00", "09:00", "10:00"],
  "bookedDetails": [
    {
      "time_slot": "11:00",
      "first_name": "Alice",
      "telegram_username": "alice_tg",
      "notes": "Study session"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Get Upcoming Bookings

`GET /api/bookings/upcoming/:level`

Returns active bookings strictly bounded from the current day to the end of the following calendar week (Sunday).

### Create Booking

`POST /api/bookings`

Accepts an array of consecutive hourly slots. The server validates overlaps and conflicts per lounge level.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "telegramUser": { "id": "987654321", "first_name": "Bob" },
  "lounge_level": 9,
  "date": "2026-03-15",
  "timeSlots": ["08:00", "09:00"],
  "notes": "Project meeting"
}
```

### Get User Bookings

`GET /api/bookings/user/:telegramId`

Returns active bookings for the requested Telegram user. Uses strict string matching to support large user IDs.

### Cancel Booking

`DELETE /api/bookings/:id`

Cancellation requires the Telegram ID to match the booking owner; the server verifies authorization via database JOINs.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "telegramId": "987654321"
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Data Integrity

- **Verified Identity:** In production, every booking, cancellation, and profile lookup requires a valid Telegram Mini App `initData` payload, whose HMAC signature is checked server-side against the bot token. Identity is derived from the verified payload — never trusted from the request body — so users cannot impersonate one another or forge admin access. Outside production, a local fallback identity is accepted for browser testing.
- **Output Escaping:** User-supplied names and handles are HTML-escaped before rendering, preventing stored XSS via booking metadata.
- **Slot Validation:** Requested time slots are validated against the known slot list and de-duplicated before insertion.
- **Data Type Safety:** Telegram IDs are explicitly cast to strings and sanitized to prevent `.0` float artifacts in the database.
- **Trust Proxy:** Support for correct client IP handling behind cloud proxies.
- **Rate Limiting:** Middleware to mitigate API abuse while allowing trusted proxies.
- **Parameterized Queries:** SQL queries use `?` placeholders to prevent SQL injection.
- **Ownership Verification:** Strict authorization subqueries for cancellation and booking management.

## 🌐 Deployment (Railway Recommended)

1. Create and mount a **Volume** at `/app/data` to persist `lounge_bookings.db` across container restarts.
2. Set the required environment variables in your Railway project settings (including ADMIN_IDS).
3. Deploy the project and ensure HTTPS is enabled for the generated web app URL (a strict Telegram requirement).
